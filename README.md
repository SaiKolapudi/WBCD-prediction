# WBCD (Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis) Prediction


This repository contains the code and files related to predicting breast cancer diagnosis using various machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to achieve the highest possible accuracy in predicting whether a given breast cancer diagnosis is malignant or benign.

## Achieved Results

Over time, several machine learning models have been implemented and tested on the WBCD dataset, resulting in impressive accuracy rates:

- **RobustScaler Naive Bayes**: Achieved 100% accuracy.
- **RobustScaler Naive Bayes-Copy1**: Achieved 100% accuracy.
- **PCA Test**: Achieved 90% accuracy.
- **Naive Bayes**: Achieved 93% accuracy.
- **Feature Selection Naive Bayes**: Achieved 97.6% accuracy.
- **LDA**: Implementation details pending.
- **Untitled**: Implementation details pending.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "diagnostic.csv" file. This dataset contains features extracted from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies and includes information about various characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images. The goal is to predict whether a diagnosis is malignant or benign based on these features.
